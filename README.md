## A fully functional OWP Learning Portal project written in Vue.js that creates a modern, user-friendly student center integrated directly into the official OWP website at California State University of Sacramento!

This colloborative senior project is a industry-grade redesign that provides the OWP website with:

- Personalized dashboard with greetings, course tracking, and certificates
- Streamlines access to certificates, purchase history, account management, and operator number updates
- Uses API-based data retrieval (no direct database access) for security and scalability
- Employs modern web technologies (Vue.js, Tailwind CSS, PHP, SQL) for performance and maintainability

With that in mind our expected outcomes are:​

- Enhanced student experience through intuitive navigation and updated UI
- Improved accessibility to learning materials and certification information
- Seamless integration with OWP’s existing systems
- A sustainable and maintainable platform for future OWP growth
- Personalized Webpages​
- Ease of access​
- Intuitive navigation​
